			p "A patient of mine recommended MyBolus to me. I was concerned that is would be too time consuming and difficult to use...But it's easy! It's just a couple of clicks and you're done! If you're serious about fitness or weight loss or eating better, MyBolus is an excellent way to keep you in check and on track."
				p - Dr. E. Ville

			h2 Completely free - really!
			p Frankly, I thought that MyBolus would not work. I figured it would start out free and once I was hooked, there would be a price involved...but that has not happened â€” free really means free.
